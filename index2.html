        <h2>Starbucks Company Profile</h2>
        <h3>The Starbucks Story</h3>
        <p>
            Our story began in 1971. Back then we were a roaster and retailer of whole bean and ground coffee, tea and
            spices with a single store in Seattle’s Pike Place Market.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, we are privileged to connect with millions of customers every day with exceptional products and more
            than 30,000 retail stores in 80 markets.
        </p>
        <h3>Folklore</h3>
        <p>
            Starbucks is named after the first mate in Herman Melville’s Moby Dick. Our logo is also inspired by the sea
            – featuring a twin-tailed siren from Greek mythology.
        </p>
        <h3>Starbucks Mission</h3>
        <p>
            Our mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Coffee</h3>
        <p>We’ve always believed in serving the best coffee possible. It's our goal for all of our coffee to be grown
            under the highest standards of quality, using ethical sourcing practices. Our coffee buyers personally
            travel to coffee farms in Latin America, Africa and Asia to select high quality beans. And our master
            roasters bring out the balance and rich flavor of the beans through the signature Starbucks Roast.</p>

            for our partners, including comprehensive health coverage for eligible full- and part-time partners, access

        <h3>Being a Responsible Company</h3>
        <p>At Starbucks, we have always believed in the importance of building a great, enduring company that strikes a
            balance between profitability and a social conscience.</p>
        <p>It started with our early travels to the places where our coffee is grown, understanding that our future is
            inextricably tied to the futures of farmers and their families. We nurtured personal relationships and built
            a global network of support to create a new way to produce coffee: one that is sustainable, transparent and
            good for people and the planet. As the threats of climate change have grown, we have been working to help
            coffee farms adapt and find innovative solutions in how we build and operate our stores, while reducing the
            environmental impact of our cups, straws and lids.</p>
        <p>Our stores are often the heart of a neighborhood, and we strive to make each one a welcoming and inclusive
            Third Place. As we have grown, so too has our opportunity to make a positive impact, from alleviating hunger
            through our food donation program to making investments in local partnerships and coffee- and tea-origin
            communities through The Starbucks Foundation.</p>
        <p>Stitching all these efforts together is a common thread – a green thread – one that is woven in the fabric of
            our company by the more than 300,000 men and women who proudly wear the green apron. We are dedicated to
            making our partners proud, providing pay equity and investing in their success. And we are working to hire
            veterans and military spouses, refugees, Opportunity Youth and those formerly incarcerated, and helping them
            build their futures once they are with us.</p>
        <p>As it has been from the beginning, our purpose goes far beyond profit. We believe in the pursuit of doing
            good.</p>
